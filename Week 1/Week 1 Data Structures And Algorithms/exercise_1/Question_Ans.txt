1. Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

Answer: 

The Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms are :
Efficiency: Large inventories require efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms to handle vast amounts of data quickly.
Search and Update Operations: Algorithms ensure that operations like adding, updating, and deleting products are performed optimally, maintaining system performance.

2. Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

Answer: 

The Suitable Data Structures are :
ArrayList: Suitable for scenarios where elements need to be accessed by index, but less efficient for searching.
HashMap: Ideal for scenarios requiring fast lookups by key (in this case, productId). Provides average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations.

4. Analysis:
Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

Answer: 

The Time Complexity Analysis :
Add Operation: O(1) on average for HashMap, assuming a good hash function and minimal collisions.
Update Operation: O(1) for HashMap if the product exists, otherwise O(1) for insertion.
Delete Operation: O(1) for HashMap, assuming the product exists.

The Optimization Strategies are :
Hash Function Optimization: We must ensure a well-distributed hash function to minimize collisions.
Batch Processing: For bulk operations (e.g., adding multiple products),we should consider batch processing to reduce overhead.
Caching: We must Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed products in memory, improving retrieval times.
